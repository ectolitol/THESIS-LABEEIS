### **Why `git add` is Required**

- **Stage Changes**: `git add` adds modified files to the staging area, which is a place where you prepare files before committing. Git needs to know which changes you want to include in your next commit.

- **Selective Commit**: Using `git add` allows you to be selective about what changes you include in each commit. You can choose specific files or parts of files to stage, which helps you create meaningful commits.

### **Typical Workflow**

1. **Edit Your Code**: Make changes to your files.

2. **Check Status (Optional)**: View which files have been modified:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. **Stage Changes**: Add the files you want to include in your next commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git add filename
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**: Save the staged changes with a commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

### **Why You Might Need to Stage Changes Again**

- **New Modifications**: If youâ€™ve edited files again after the last commit, you'll need to stage these new changes to include them in your next commit.

- **Unstaged Changes**: Git only tracks changes after the last commit. Any new modifications need to be staged to be committed.

### **Practical Example**

1. **Day 1**:
   - You edit `file1.js` and `file2.js`.
   - Stage and commit:
     ```bash
     git add file1.js file2.js
     git commit -m "Initial changes"
     ```

2. **Day 2**:
   - You make further changes to `file1.js`.
   - Stage and commit only the new changes:
     ```bash
     git add file1.js
     git commit -m "Updated file1.js"
     ```

In summary, every time you make new changes and want to include them in your repository, you need to use `git add` to stage those changes before committing. This process ensures that only the intended modifications are recorded in your commit history.
